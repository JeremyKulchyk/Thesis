PatheticOur not very bright Vice President Joe Biden just stated that I wanted to "carpet bomb" the enemy. Sorry Joe that was Ted Cruz!Crooked Hillary Clinton wants to flood our country with Syrian immigrants that we know little or nothing about. The danger is massive. NO!Hopefully the violent and vicious killing by ISIS of a beloved French priest is causing people to start thinking rationally. Get tough!The Democratic Convention has paid ZERO respect to the great police and law enforcement professionals of our country. No recognition - SAD!Funny how the failing @nytimes is pushing Dems narrative that Russia is working for me because Putin said "Trump is a genius." America 1st!As I have been saying Crooked Hillary will approve the job killing TPP after the election despite her statements to the contrary: top adv.Just like I have warned from the beginning Crooked Hillary Clinton will betray you on the TPP. https://t.co/eoNTWK6I8yMany of Bernie's supporters have left the arena. Did Bernie go home and go to sleep?I hate to say it but the Republican Convention was far more interesting (with a much more beautiful set) than the Democratic Convention!No matter what Bill Clinton says and no matter how well he says it the phony media will exclaim it to be incredible.

Crazy!Dems don't want to talk ISIS b/c Hillary's foreign interventions unleashed ISIS &amp; her refugee plans make it easier for them to come here.Bernie's exhausted he just wants to shut down and go home to bed!The invention of email has proven to be a very bad thing for Crooked Hillary in that it has proven her to be both incompetent and a liar!Thank you New Hampshire! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain https://t.co/KRCdV77BQpJoin us in Toledo Ohio- tomorrow night at 8pm! #TrumpPence16 #MAGATickets: https://t.co/ERNRrksikq https://t.co/zmGZauCnQFJoin us tomorrow in Scranton Pennsylvania at 3pm!#TrumpPence16 #MAGA Tickets: https://t.co/4FTydj8s9U https://t.co/7zMKhhMmhpPocahontas bombed last night! Sad to watch.Why aren't the Democrats speaking about ISIS bad trade deals broken borders police and law and order. The Republican Convention was greatFunny if you listen to @FoxNews the Democrats did not have a good day. If you listen to the other two they are fawning. What a differenceBernie Sanders totally sold out to Crooked Hillary Clinton. All of that work energy and money and nothing to show for it! Waste of time.Elizabeth Warren often referred to as Pocahontas just misrepresented me and spoke glowingly about Crooked Hillary who she always hated!Sad to watch Bernie Sanders abandon his revolution. We welcome all voters who want to fix our rigged system and bring back our jobs.If Cory Booker is the future of the Democratic Party they have no future! I know more about Cory than he knows about himself.I was at @FoxNews and met Juan Williams in passing. He asked if he could have pictures taken with me. I said fine. He then trashes on air!Hard to believe that Bernie Sanders has done such a complete fold. He got NOTHING for all of the time energy and money. The V.P. a joke!While Bernie has totally given up on his fight for the people we welcome all voters who want a better future for our workers.Clinton betrayed Bernie voters.

People don't want another four years of Obama and Crooked Hillary would be even worse. #MAGAThe State of Florida is so embarrassed by the antics of Crooked Hillary Clinton and Debbie Wasserman Schultz that they will vote for CHANGE!Wow the Republican Convention went so smoothly compared to the Dems total mess. But fear not the dishonest media will find a good spinnnn!Here we go again with another Clinton scandal and e-mails yet (can you believe). Crooked Hillary knew the fix was in B never had a chance!Crooked Hillary Clinton knew everything that her "servant" was doing at the DNC - they just got caught that's all! They laughed at Bernie.If Bernie Sanders after seeing the just released e-mails continues to look exhausted and done then his legacy will never be the same.Thank you! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain https://t.co/Pzs9uwgzamHillary was involved in the e-mail scandal because she is the only one with judgement so bad that such a thing could have happened!How much BAD JUDGEMENT was on display by the people in DNC in writing those really dumb e-mails using even religion against Bernie!The new joke in town is that Russia leaked the disastrous DNC e-mails which should never have been written (stupid) because Putin likes meWatched Crooked Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine on 60 Minutes. No way they are going to fix America's problems. ISIS &amp; all others laughing!The ratings for the Republican National Convention were very good but for the final night my speech great. Thank you!The highly neurotic Debbie Wasserman Schultz is angry that after stealing and cheating her way to a Crooked Hillary victory she's out!The Democrats are in a total meltdown but the biased media will say how great they are doing! E-mails say the rigged system is alive &amp; well!Even though Bernie Sanders has lost his energy and his strength I don't believe that his supporters will let Crooked Hillary off the hook!Crooked Hillary Clinton was not at all loyal to the person in her rigged system that pushed her over the top DWS. Too bad Bernie flamed outIf the Republican Convention had blown up with e-mails resignation of boss and the beat down of a big player. (Bernie) media would go wildThe @CNN panels are so one sided almost all against Trump. @FoxNews is so much better and the ratings are much higher. Don't watch CNN!I always said that Debbie Wasserman Schultz was overrated. The Dems Convention is cracking up and Bernie is exhausted no energy left!Today proves what I have always known that @Reince Priebus is the tough one and the smart one not Debbie Wasserman Shultz (@DWStweets.)Sorry folks but Bernie Sanders is exhausted just can't go on any longer. He is trying to dismiss the new e-mails and DNC disrespect. SAD!There is no longer a Bernie Sanders "political revolution." He is turning out to be a weak and somewhat pathetic figurewants it all to end!An analysis showed that Bernie Sanders would have won the Democratic nomination if it were not for the Super Delegates.Looks like the Bernie people will fight. If not their BLOOD SWEAT AND TEARS was a total waste of time. Kaine stands for opposite!Wow President Obama's brother Malik just announced that he is voting for me. Was probably treated badly by president-like everybody else!Bernie Sanders started off strong but with the selection of Kaine for V.P. is ending really weak. So much for a movement! TOTAL DISRESPECTThe Crooked Hillary V.P. choice is VERY disrespectful to Bernie Sanders and all of his supporters. Just another case of BAD JUDGEMENT by H!#MakeAmericaGreatAgain#TrumpPence16 https://t.co/gCzHX1nyxD"@NancyNielsenn: @realDonaldTrump Dinesh D'Sousa Hillary's America. see it""@OliMauritania: @realDonaldTrump Kaine supported the stupidest deal in the history of deals https://t.co/0FFeKTsuJn #HillaryKaine2016"Thank you to everyone for the wonderful reviews of my speech on Thursday night. From the heart!The Wikileaks e-mail release today was so bad to Sanders that it will make it impossible for him to support her unless he is a fraud!Just saw Crooked Hillary and Tim Kaine together. ISIS and our other enemies are drooling. They don't look presidential to me!I will bring jobs back and get wages up. People haven't had a real wage increase in almost twenty years. Clinton killed jobs!Tim Kaine has been praising the Trans Pacific Partnership and has been pushing hard to get it approved. Job killer!Funny that the Democrats would have their convention in Pennsylvania where her husband and her killed so many jobs. I will bring jobs back!Crooked Hillary Clinton has destroyed jobs and manufacturing in Pennsylvania. Against steelworkers and miners. Husband signed NAFTA.Leaked e-mails of DNC show plans to destroy Bernie Sanders. Mock his heritage and much more. On-line from Wikileakes really vicious. RIGGEDPocahontas wanted V.P. slot so badly but wasn't chosen because she has done nothing in the Senate. Also Crooked Hillary hates her!Tim Kaine is and always has been owned by the banks. Bernie supporters are outraged was their last choice. Bernie fought for nothing!The Bernie Sanders supporters are furious with the choice of Tim Kaine who represents the opposite of what Bernie stands for. Philly fight?"@Theresa_Cali: @realDonaldTrump General Michael Flynn will make a great Secretary of Defense when you become POTUS! #MakeAmericaSafeAgain"I highly recommend the just out book - THE FIELD OF FIGHT - by General Michael Flynn.

Sad!Wow just announced that Lyin' Ted and Kasich are going to collude in order to keep me from getting the Republican nomination. DESPERATION!I am happy to hear how badly the @nytimes is doing.

Notice has just been withdrawn. #Trump2016#MakeAmericaGreatAgainThe RNC which is probably not on my side just illegally put out a fundraising notice saying Trump wants you to contribute to the RNC.Now an additional 600-700 jobs in America (2000) being eliminated for move to Mexico- via Hartford Courant. https://t.co/bOIYQLqGRG"@jd4160: Nice column by Bill Donahue head of Catholic League. He's a blue collar New Yorker and gets it https://t.co/cbUPNuGnUB"I am the only one who can fix this. Very sad.

First non native born in history?""@by @tedcruz good I want to see the court decide what I was always told "natural born" means - born on American soil""@hillx123: @tedcruz you have just been put on notice @realDonaldTrump We Stand with you... #MakeAmericaGreatAgain" Thankyou.Last time lightweight @JebBush tried to knock off @marcorubio he made a total fool of himself. If he doesn't do better this time he is out!If @TedCruz doesn‚Äôt clean up his act stop cheating &amp; doing negative ads I have standing to sue him for not being a natural born citizen.Lightweight @JebBush is spending a fortune of special interest against me in SC. False advertising- desperate and sad!After hearing the news that they would not be able to extort $1M from me they went hostile w/ a series of incorrect &amp; ill-informed ads.Nothing conservative about the Club for Growth coming into my office and demanding a $1M contribution which naturally they did not get.You must be registered Republican by February 16th to vote TRUMP in the Florida primary. https://t.co/xZzUkjV3lLhttps://t.co/lPuprzJBQ5The failing @NYDailyNews destroyed by little Morty Zuckerman is preparing to close and save face by going online.

Tomorrow is the deadline to register Republican.Visit: https://t.co/bHZ4JVckOpMessage from @IvankaTrump: https://t.co/SZTq1QOXEgHow can Ted Cruz be an Evangelical Christian when he lies so much and is so dishonest?Lying Cruz put out a statement ‚ÄúTrump &amp; Rubio are w/Obama on gay marriage." Cruz is the worst liar crazy or very dishonest. Perhaps all 3?Weak JEB getting thrown out by management during speech. Do you think he will be this tough on Putin &amp; others? https://t.co/Tqej1euLVLTHANK YOU- Baton Rouge Louisiana!

Just ask @RealBenCarson"Heading to Baton Rouge Louisiana for a speech. Expecting a very large crowd! See you soon. #Trump2016 #MakeAmericaGreatAgainWe are getting reports from many voters that the Cruz people are back to doing very sleazy and dishonest "pushpolls" on me. We are watching!Jeb failed as Jeb! He gave up and enlisted Mommy and his brother (who got us into the quicksand of Iraq). Spent $120 million.Weak-no chance!He (or she) who hesitates is lost: MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!Remember it was the Republican Party with the help of Conservatives that made so many promises to their base BUT DIDN'T KEEP THEM! Hi DT.@MarkHalperin showed a focus group on @Morning_Joe me using a very bad word. I never said the word left an open blank. Please apologize!Jeb Bush spent more than $40000000 in New Hampshire to come in 4 or 5 I spent $3000000 to come in 1st. Big difference in capability!There are no buyers for the worthless @NYDailyNews but little Mort Zuckerman is frantically looking. It is bleeding red ink - a total loser!I have been consistent in my opposition to Common Core. Get rid of Common Core--- keep education local!THANK YOU- Clemson South Carolina! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #SCPrimary https://t.co/FgACmaFxxc"@HARyder: Which is it @realDonaldTrump ?Are you planning on getting rid of Common Core or keeping it? Get rid of it fast.I was referring to the fact that Jeb Bush wants to keep common core.Big speech tonight in South Carolina - 7:00 P.M. Tremendous crowd!So funny Jeb Bush called me a "highly gifted politician and a great entertainer" - I assume that is a compliment!Such a great experience in New Hampshire - amazing people! Will be leaving for a big event in South Carolina today.Like the worthless @NYDailyNews looks like @politico will be going out of business. Bad reporting- no money no cred!Worthless @NYDailyNews which dopey Mort Zuckerman is desperately trying to sell has no buyer!

Great!No-one has done more for people with disabilities than me. I have spent many millions of dollars to help out-and am happy to have done so!I know the "Governors" and Jeb Bush who has gone nasty with lies is by far the weakest of the lot. His family used private eminent domain!Remember @JebBush wants COMMON CORE (education from D.C.) and is very weak on ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION ("come as act of love").
